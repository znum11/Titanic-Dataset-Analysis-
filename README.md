# Titanic Analysis
Data Analysis of passenger information such as survival, gender, class, age, ticket price what factors influenced their survival.
Titanic Dataset Analysis Using Python
Objective: To analyse passenger information such as survival, gender, class, age, ticket price what factors influenced their survival.
Tools used: 
•	Python: (Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualisations). 
Methodologies Used:
1.	Data cleaning: Handled missing values, useless data and wrong datatype.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Survival rates by gender, class, age groups, Average fares for survivors vs. non-survivors.
3.	Visualisation Technique: Bar charts (eg, survival by class).
Histograms (eg, age distribution).
Heatmaps 
Final Outcomes:-
Females had a much higher survival rate (around 74% survived) than males (only ~19% survived).
First-class passengers survived much more than second/third-class. Money and privilege saved lives.
Children (especially under 10) had a higher survival chance. Young adults and older people were less likely to survive.

The "women and children first" policy was followed.   Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive.
Being wealthy helped people survive - access to lifeboats, location of rooms, and staff prioritisation mattered. In a nutshell, on the Titanic, your survival mainly depended on being a woman or a child, being rich, and being in first class. Poor men in the third class had the lowest chance of surviving.
